# hyperswarm-terminal-chat
Hyperswarm Terminal Chat is a peer-to-peer (P2P) chat application built using Hyperswarm, a decentralized networking stack developed by Holepunch, backed by Tether and Bitfinex. It enables communication without central servers, supporting both public broadcasts and direct messaging between peers. All from the terminal.
